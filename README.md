## ‚ú® Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload images from the mobile gallery to scan them for potential manipulation.
- **Real-Time Image Forgery Detection**: Identifies tampering using custom-trained models deployed on Hugging Face.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Communicates with the FastAPI backend to process images and provide analysis results.
- **Instant Feedback**: Receive instant results on the authenticity of uploaded images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: Frontend for creating a cross-platform mobile application.
- **FastAPI**: Backend API service for handling image processing and running detection models.
- **Hugging Face**: Hosting and deployment of a custom-trained machine learning model for image forgery detection.

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kamal934/PixelProof.git
cd PixelProof
```

### 2. Install Flutter dependencies
Ensure you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. Then, in the project directory, run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Running the App
To launch the Pixel Proof mobile app, connect your device or emulator and run:
```bash
flutter run
```


## üí° How It Works

 - **Image Upload**: Users can upload images from their mobile gallery through the app.
 - **Backend Processing**: The app sends the image to the FastAPI backend, which processes it using a custom-trained model hosted on Hugging Face.
 - **Forgery Detection**: The backend analyzes the image for signs of tampering and returns a result, which is displayed to the user.
 - **Real-Time Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback on the image‚Äôs authenticity.

## üîÆ Future Scope

1. **Automatic Image Capture**: Enable users to capture images directly from the app for on-the-spot analysis.
2. **Batch Image Scanning**: Support for scanning multiple images at once to improve productivity.
3. **Cloud-Based Processing**: Integration with cloud storage solutions (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for remote image uploads and analysis.
4. **Enhanced Detection Models**: Incorporate more advanced models to detect deepfakes and other sophisticated manipulations.
5. **Tamper Analysis History**: Maintain a detailed log of all scanned images, providing users with a history of forgery checks and results.
